      <p>Greetings! I'm Danielle Rodriguez, a Florida-based 3D artist known for my intricate hard surface modelling and captivating natural environments. I bring concepts to life by fusing artistry and precision, crafting awe-inspiring 3D creations that range from detailed structures to expansive scenes.

        My toolkit includes a variety of skills such as modelling, lighting, texturing, sculpting, and rendering. Beyond my technical skills, I am fueled by an insatiable curiosity, constantly adapting and learning to keep my work fresh and innovative. Collaboration is my heartbeat, as I thrive in dynamic environments where ideas meld.
        
        As a versatile 3D Generalist, I embrace challenges that fuel my growth. Proficient in Blender, Adobe Substance Suite, Unity, Unreal Engine, Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, I seamlessly traverse from concept to visualization, creating everything from intricate buildings to breathtaking landscapes.
